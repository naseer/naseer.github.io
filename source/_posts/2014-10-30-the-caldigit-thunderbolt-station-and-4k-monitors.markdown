Macbook Pros are powerful developer machines that you can hook up monitors and keyboards to to convert into nice workstations. Yet, Apple doesn't provide any standard dock for them. Enter, the [Caldigit Thunderbolt Station](http://www.caldigit.com/thunderboltstation/), which is a great little docking station for expanding peripherals for devices that support Thunderbolt.

I have a keyboard, mouse, headphones and an Android device for debugging connected to this docking station. Originally, I also had one 4k monitor hooked up as well with DisplayPort 1.1. However, DisplayPort 1.1 is only capable of 4k@30fps. For regular use, 30 fps is too janky for my eyes, so I had to go back to 60 fps. Option one was to go back to a lower resolution - but that's not progress!
So I chose Option two - which was to switch to DisplayPort 1.2, support for which came in a point update to Mavericks.
